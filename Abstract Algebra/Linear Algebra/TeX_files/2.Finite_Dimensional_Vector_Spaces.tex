\section{Span and Linear Independence}
\textbf{Linear Combination:} Is a vector formed from a list $(\mathcal{V}_{1}, ... ,\mathcal{V}_{i})$ of vectors with the structure
\begin{equation}
	\sum_{i}^{n} a_{i}\mathcal{V}_{i}
\end{equation}
$\forall \ a_{i} \in \mathcal{F}$\\
\subsection{Span}
The \textbf{Span} of is the set of all linear combinations denoted as
\begin{equation}
	span(\mathcal{V}_{1}, ... ,\mathcal{Vw}_{i}) = \{\sum_{i}^{n} a_{i}\mathcal{V}_{i} : a_{i} \in \mathcal{F} \}
\end{equation}
The span of any list of vectors in $\mathbb{V}$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{V}$ until and unless we consider an empty list, in that case $span() = \{\}$\\[0.1in]
If $span(\mathcal{V}_{1}, ... ,\mathcal{V}_{i}) = \mathbb{V}$, then we say that $span(\mathcal{V}_{1}, ... ,\mathcal{V}_{i}) \ $ \textbf{spans} $\mathbb{V}$.\\[2in]
A vector space is said to be finite dimensional if it spanned by a list of vectors in it. This follows from the definition that a list must be finite.
A vector space that is not finite dimensional is said to be infinite dimensional, a good example of are the elements of Polynomials over a field i.e. $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{F})$
