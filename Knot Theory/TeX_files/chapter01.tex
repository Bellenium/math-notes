\begin{itemize}
	\item A knot is defined by the number of twistings it has?
	\item There are many pictures of the same knot, they are called projections of the same knot.
	\item Unknot = No Knot, just a bloody circle
	\item An interesting type of knot is the alternating knot := has crossing that alternate between over and under as one travels around the knot in a fixed direction
	\item We can define new knots by removing a small part of one knot and then connecting the endpoints to another broken knot
	\item Such a knot (called a composite knot) is said to be the composition of two knots, denoted by $J$#$K$, where $J$ and $k$ are called factor knots
